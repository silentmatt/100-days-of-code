# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started a desktop Tic-Tac-Toe using Electron. I cloned the electron-quick-start project, and added a basic Promise-based game class, with a random "AI" to test the flow of the game.

**Thoughts** I didn't end up doing anything Electron-specific yet, so the quick start project hasn't really done anything at this point. I actually might end up going with another starter project that comes with more out of the box. We'll see.
